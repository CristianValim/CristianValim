# Priviet! I'm Cristian, but you can call me Cris ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently developing (HA HA) an incredible love for Frontend and Backend development, trying to solve problems with technology.

## About Me

I am specializing in both frontend and backend development, exploring new technologies and enhancing my skills. My goal is to create meaningful and impactful projects.

BTW! I am excited to share that I will be participating in the [42 Piscine](https://www.42.us.org/en) in September 2024. It is an intensive coding bootcamp, hosted by the 42 network (a world-famous dev school), that will allow me to deepen my programming skills, collaborate with other developers, and tackle challenging projects in a unique learning environment.

**Key Skills:**
- Frontend Development with React, HTML5, and CSS3 + Styled Components
- Backend Development with Node.js and Express
- Knowledge of SQL databases
- Experience with RESTful APIs and authentication
